# Aber-Traethlin

Traethlin (shoreline in Welsh) is the rover we (some members of the Intelligent Robotics group, department of Computer Science, Aberystwyth University, http://aber.ac.uk/en/cs/research/ir) have developed (and are still developing) as part of the Coastal Research Autonomous Navigation Crawler project, a collaboration with the Wales Coastal Monitoring Centre (https://www.wcmc.wales/).

You'll find here code, scripts and documentation to setup the rover.  Code of CRANC is at https://github.com/Aber-CRANC.
